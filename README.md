# TicTacToe-Java
A simple tic tac toe console game made in eclipse worksplace.
You can play against the computer or your friend (on the same PC).

The main algorithm here is to figure out which player won, there are 8 options for a win.
So for that I have the "checkGameStatus()" method, I attached a pic of all the win options so it's easier to understand

Future updates:
1. Add an option to play on your local network
2. Make the "bot" smarter and harder to win
3. Add a GUI for the game


Enjoy!
